  "model_output": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Turing Test: Definition, Theoretical Foundations, and Historical Evolution [1-6]\n\nThe Turing Test is a benchmark for assessing the intelligence of machines, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 [5]. In this test, a human evaluator engages in a natural language conversation with both a human and an AI, without knowing which one they are communicating with. If the evaluator cannot reliably distinguish between the two, the machine is considered to have passed the test and demonstrated artificial intelligence [1]. The theoretical foundations of the Turing Test suggest that an intelligent machine should be able to mimic human-like conversation and deceive humans into believing they are conversing with a human. This implies that language comprehension, reasoning, and the ability to create meaningful responses are essential components of artificial intelligence [2]. The definition of machine intelligence has evolved historically across publications. In the 1950s, Turing proposed the Imitation Game as a test for assessing machine intelligence [5]. Later in 2007, researchers worked on defining and measuring machine intelligence by mathematically formalizing essential features of human intelligence [3]. This definition aims to capture the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. In recent years, there has been a focus on developing AI models capable of understanding complex languages and performing tasks such as summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. These advancements have pushed the boundaries of AI research, leading to improved performance on various benchmarks [6].
