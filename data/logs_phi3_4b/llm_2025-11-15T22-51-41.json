Never infer missing event years. Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nCompare and contrast the main theoretical perspectives on outline the core subfields of ai mentioned in the corpus., grounding historical claims only in explicit snippet content.\n\nYou are given the following context snippets from historical AI-related documents.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] 0712.3329v1.pdf (2007)\n.

The interested reader is referred to \"Handbook of Intelligence\" edited by R. J. Sternberg for an overview [Ste00]. 2. **Binet's Intelligence Test** (event year not stated; described in 2007 PDF [1] and 2024 PDF [2])\n   - Binet's test was initially developed to measure the intelligence of children, and it was found that the results were a good predictor of their academic performance. Lewis Terman of Stanford University played a significant role in this research [Bin11]. 3. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** (event year not stated; described in 2024 PDF [2])\n   - AI researchers focus on the development of machine-based intelligence, as opposed to general AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). The essence of intelligence in AI is characterized by reasoning capabilities, hypothesis testing, and preparing for future eventualities. 4. **Machine Generated Text Detection** (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [3])\n   - This subfield involves the detection of machine-generated text. The most complete survey of this topic includes previously omitted feature-based work and findings from recent contemporary research [3]. 5. **Threat Models enabled by Machine Generated Text** (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [3])\n   - This subfield focuses on the threat models posed by machine-generated text, particularly at a critical juncture where Natural Language Generation (NLG) models and tools are rapidly improving and proliferating. 6. **Trustworthy AI (TAI)** (event year not stated; described in 2023 PDF [3])\n   - TAI provides a meaningful exploration of both machine-generated text detection and the associated threat models. 7. **Language Model (LLM) Research** (event year not stated; described in 2025 PDF [5])\n   - The research on LLMs has been advanced by both academia and industry, with notable progress leading to the launch of ChatGPT, a powerful AI chatbot developed based on LLMs. This technical evolution is impacting the entire AI community and revolutionizing AI algorithms development. 8. **Defining Machine Intelligence** (event year not stated; described in 2007 PDF [1])\n   - The problem of defining machine intelligence involves understanding the essence of intelligence in broad terms, particularly for artificial systems that are significantly different from humans. The fundamental issue is that nobody really knows what intelligence is [1].
