Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of list examples of electronics expert systems cited in the corpus., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nYou are given the following context snippets from historical AI-related documents.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.

Some early examples of medical expert systems include MYCIN, ONCOCIN, GUIDON, and ABEL [1], while in electronics, ACE, EURISKO, SOPHIE, PALLADIO, REDESIGN, TALIB, and CADHELP are notable examples [1]. 2. **General Architecture:** The general architecture of an expert system consists of a user interface, explanation facility, working memory, inference engine, and knowledge base [1]. 3. **Knowledge Representation:** Knowledge representation in classical expert systems includes a set of IF-THEN rules or heuristic and empirical knowledge [1]. Connectionist Expert Systems Based on Artificial Neural Networks use neural networks as the knowledge base for classification tasks [1]. 4. **Strengths:** Expert systems have been successful in emulating human knowledge and skill, which has encouraged their development in various areas such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, and more [1]. Inductive learning used in neural network expert systems helps prevent the knowledge acquisition bottleneck when there is much empirical data [1]. 5. **Limitations:** Currently, expert systems are built with heuristic and empirical knowledge rather than deep knowledge that includes models of functional and causal relations underlying a problem [1]. Using multiple sources of knowledge in a cooperative manner remains a difficult problem to tackle [1]. 6. **Explanation Facility:** The developers of expert systems and decision support systems have long been aware of the importance of facilities to explain the computer-based reasoning to users for their more widespread acceptance [2]. 7. **Application:** After leaving research laboratories during the early 1980s, expert systems became more popular and found applications in various fields such as engineering, chemistry, medicine, industry, and many others [1].
