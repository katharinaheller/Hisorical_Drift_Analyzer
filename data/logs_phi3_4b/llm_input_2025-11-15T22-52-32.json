Use numeric IEEE-style citations [1], [2], etc., for statements supported by the provided snippets. Each number corresponds to one unique PDF listed below. Multiple snippets originating from the same PDF share the same number. Never assign multiple citation numbers to the same source.\n\n**Your final answer MUST end with a separate section titled 'References'.**\nThis section MUST list all unique PDFs exactly once, in the following strict format:\n[n] FILENAME.pdf (YEAR)\n\nDo not fabricate author names, journals, or article titles — only use the given filename and metadata year.\n\nTemporal Attribution Rules:\n1. You may ONLY use event years that appear explicitly in the snippet text.\n2. If the snippet text explicitly contains a year (e.g., 'In the 1950s', 'In 1976'), treat that as the factual historical reference.\n3. If a snippet DOES NOT contain an explicit event year, you MUST NOT guess, infer, approximate, or estimate any year.\n   Instead, write exactly: '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n4. The metadata publication year indicates only when the PDF was published, not when the events occurred.\n5. Never replace or override an explicit event year with a metadata year.\n6. Never deduce approximate historical periods from textual content (e.g., never infer '1990s' unless explicitly stated).\n\nOutput Structuring Guidelines:\n- For every key historical or conceptual point:\n  • If an explicit event year exists in the snippet → include it.\n  • If no explicit event year exists → write '(event year not stated; described in YEAR PDF [n])'.\n- Recommended dual-year structure:\n  • (1950s; described in 2025 PDF [7]) The Turing Test was proposed as a benchmark.\nThis dual timestamping ensures full temporal grounding without hallucination.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n**Your output MUST end with a final section titled 'References'.**\nThis section must list all unique PDFs exactly once in IEEE numeric format.\n\nRefined query:\nAnalyze the mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of list examples of early medical expert systems cited in the corpus., noting origins only when explicitly stated.\n\nYou are given the following context snippets from historical AI-related documents.\n\nContext snippets:\n[1] Expert_Systems.pdf (2016)\n.
